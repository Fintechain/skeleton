# Architecture Review Quick Guide

This guide provides a streamlined approach to conducting architecture reviews of the Fintechain skeleton using the comprehensive [Architecture Review Prompt](./ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md).

## Quick Review Process

### 1. Pre-Review Setup (5 minutes)
- [ ] Clone/update the skeleton repository
- [ ] Review recent changes in CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] Check for any open issues or PRs
- [ ] Prepare review environment

### 2. Rapid Assessment (15 minutes)
Quickly scan each area and assign initial scores:

| Area | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Package Organization | ___ | |
| Factory Patterns | ___ | |
| Interface Design | ___ | |
| Error Handling | ___ | |
| Documentation | ___ | |
| Testing | ___ | |
| Extensibility | ___ | |
| Performance | ___ | |
| Security | ___ | |
| Code Quality | ___ | |

### 3. Deep Dive (30 minutes)
Focus on areas with scores ≤ 3:
- Identify specific issues
- Document root causes
- Propose concrete solutions

### 4. Final Assessment (10 minutes)
- Calculate overall score
- Identify top 3 strengths
- List critical issues
- Prioritize improvements

## Critical Success Indicators

### ✅ Green Light (Score 4-5)
- All packages follow domain boundaries
- Factory patterns implemented consistently
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- No circular dependencies
- Clear error handling patterns

### ⚠️ Yellow Light (Score 3)
- Minor architectural inconsistencies
- Some documentation gaps
- Limited test coverage in some areas
- Performance considerations needed

### 🚨 Red Light (Score 1-2)
- Major architectural violations
- Missing critical functionality
- Poor error handling
- Inadequate documentation
- Security vulnerabilities

## Common Issues Checklist

### Package Organization
- [ ] Monolithic packages (split if >500 lines)
- [ ] Circular dependencies (use `go mod graph`)
- [ ] Mixed concerns in single package
- [ ] Unclear package boundaries

### Factory Patterns
- [ ] Missing factory constructors
- [ ] Inconsistent factory interfaces
- [ ] Poor error handling in factories
- [ ] No configuration support

### Interface Design
- [ ] Large interfaces (>5 methods)
- [ ] Leaky abstractions
- [ ] Inconsistent patterns
- [ ] Missing key interfaces

### Error Handling
- [ ] Generic error messages
- [ ] No error codes
- [ ] Missing error wrapping
- [ ] Inconsistent error patterns

## Review Templates

### Issue Template
```markdown
**Issue**: [Brief description]
**Area**: [Package/Component]
**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

go mod graph | grep -E "(skeleton.*skeleton)"

# Check test coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Check for common issues
golint ./...
go vet ./...

# Check documentation
godoc -http=:6060
```

## Review Frequency

- **Major Changes**: Full review required
- **Minor Changes**: Focused review on affected areas
- **Regular Maintenance**: Monthly quick review
- **Release Preparation**: Comprehensive review

## Review Outputs

```

## Best Practices

### For Reviewers
- Focus on architectural principles over code style
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Evaluate from user perspective
- Document rationale for scores
- Provide actionable recommendations

### For Development Team
- Address critical issues before minor improvements
- Maintain architectural consistency
- Update documentation with changes
- Consider backward compatibility
- Test architectural changes thoroughly

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start review
cd skeleton/
git pull origin main

# Check structure
tree pkg/ internal/

# Run tests
go test ./...

# Check dependencies
go mod graph

# Generate documentation
godoc -http=:6060

# Check for issues
golint ./pkg/...
go vet ./...
```

Use this guide alongside the comprehensive [Architecture Review Prompt](./ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW_PROMPT.md) to maintain the skeleton's architectural quality efficiently.
