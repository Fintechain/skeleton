# Implementation Fixes

We've addressed several issues in the component system implementation. This document summarizes the changes made.

## 1. Service Package Fixes

### DefaultService Improvements
- Changed from embedded `*BaseService` to proper composition with a `baseService` field
- Added delegation methods to forward to the base component
- This better aligns with the "Composition over Inheritance" design principle

### BaseService State Management
- Improved state transitions with proper handling of each state
- Added explicit error reporting for invalid state transitions
- Added helper methods for status management
- Better handling of failure conditions

### Health Check Concurrency
- Fixed potential goroutine leak in health check implementation
- Added context awareness to goroutines
- Used buffered channel to prevent blocking
- Improved timeout handling

### Context Usage
- Fixed import paths for context utilities
- Ensured proper context propagation

## 2. Plugin Package Fixes

### Plugin Discovery
- Updated the `Discover` method to return errors properly
- Made the interface signature consistent with implementation
- Improved error reporting for discovery failures

### Plugin Manager Context
- Fixed background context usage
- Properly imported context utilities
- Improved context handling in plugin lifecycle

## 3. Overall Improvements

### Error Handling
- More consistent error handling
- Better error reporting with details
- Fixed error wrapping 

### Import Paths
- Consistent usage of the temporary Go module approach
- Used proper import paths for context utilities

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive tests for all components
2. Complete the implementation of infrastructure services
3. Improve plugin discovery to handle actual plugin loading
4. Create adapters for the existing system
5. Begin migration to the new component system
