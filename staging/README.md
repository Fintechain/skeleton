# Component System Redesign Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the component system redesign as described in the design document.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Staged Migration**: We're implementing the new design in this staging area before integrating it with the main codebase.

2. **Package Structure**: The implementation follows the package structure outlined in the design document:
   - `internal/domain/component/`: Core component interfaces and types
   - `internal/domain/operation/`: Operation-specific interfaces and implementations
   - `internal/domain/service/`: Service-specific interfaces and implementations
   - `internal/domain/plugin/`: Plugin-related interfaces and implementations
   - `internal/infrastructure/`: Supporting systems like event bus, context management, etc.

3. **Type Safety**: We prioritize interface-based design with clean, well-defined interfaces.

4. **Idiomatic Go**: We follow Go best practices and idioms throughout the implementation.

## Migration Strategy

1. **Implement Core Interfaces**: First, we implement the core interfaces and types defined in the design document.

2. **Develop Base Implementations**: Next, we create base implementations that satisfy these interfaces.

3. **Create Adapters**: We'll create adapters to bridge between the existing system and the new design.

4. **Gradual Replacement**: Components of the existing system will be replaced gradually, maintaining backward compatibility.

5. **Testing**: Each component will be thoroughly tested before integration.

## Current Status

- Core component interfaces implemented
- Basic implementations of Registry, Factory, and EventBus
- Operation and Service interfaces defined
- Base implementations for Operation and Service created

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of all supporting systems
2. Develop the adapter layer to connect with existing code
3. Implement the Plugin system
4. Create tests for all components
5. Begin gradual migration of existing components to the new system
