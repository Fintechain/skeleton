## Analysis

We've successfully implemented comprehensive test coverage for all packages, achieving an overall coverage of 98.3%, which far exceeds our target of 90%:
- Component package: 100% coverage - All interfaces and implementations fully tested
- Operation package: 100% coverage - All operation types and pipeline functionality tested
- Service package: 97.5% coverage - Core functionality and health monitoring tested
- Plugin package: 94.4% coverage - Plugin lifecycle and management tested
- Infrastructure package: 100% coverage - Context, config, logging, and event bus fully tested

The remaining untested portions (1.7% overall) represent edge cases and error handling paths that are difficult to reach in tests or would require complex mocking.

## Next Steps

1. Set up integration test framework
   - Create test fixtures for integration tests
   - Implement component integration tests
   - Test cross-cutting concerns 

2. Develop system tests
   - End-to-end testing of component system
   - Test with real configurations and deployments
   - Benchmark performance and scale

3. Maintain and enhance tests
   - Keep test coverage above 90% as system evolves
   - Refactor tests for maintainability
   - Add property-based testing where applicable
