# Import Path Resolution Plan

## Current Issue

We're facing import path issues in our staging area implementation. The packages can't be imported using the absolute paths like:

```go
import "github.com/fintechain/skeleton/skeleton/staging/internal/domain/component"
```

## Option 1: Use Relative Imports During Development

For development purposes, we can use relative imports to reference packages within the staging area:

```go
// From operation package importing component
import "../component"

// From infrastructure/context importing domain/component
import "../../domain/component"
```

### Pros
- Simple to implement
- Works during development

### Cons
- Not ideal for production code
- May need to be changed when moving to the final location

## Option 2: Create a Temporary Go Module

We can create a temporary Go module in the staging directory to make the imports work:

1. Create a go.mod file in the staging directory:
```
cd skeleton/staging
go mod init github.com/fintechain/skeleton-staging
```

2. Update imports to use this module:
```go
import "github.com/fintechain/skeleton-staging/internal/domain/component"
```

### Pros
- More realistic to the final implementation
- Better IDE support

### Cons
- Requires managing a separate module
- More setup work

## Option 3: Implement in Place with Forward-Compatible Imports

Instead of a staging area, we could implement the new design directly in a branch of the main codebase:

1. Create a new branch for the redesign
2. Implement new components alongside existing ones
3. Use correct import paths from the beginning

### Pros
- No import path issues
- Direct path to production

### Cons
- Less isolation during development
- Might interfere with ongoing work

## Recommended Approach

**Option 2: Create a Temporary Go Module**

This approach provides the best balance of development isolation and realistic import paths. It will also make the transition to the final codebase easier.

### Implementation Steps

1. Create a go.mod file in the staging directory
2. Update all import paths to use the new module name
3. Run `go mod tidy` to update dependencies
4. Use the new import paths consistently in all files

When ready to integrate with the main codebase, we'll need to update the import paths again to match the final destination.
