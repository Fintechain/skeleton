# Component System Redesign Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Implementation (Completed)

We have implemented the basic foundation for the component system:

- Core Component interface
- Registry interface and basic implementation
- Factory interface and basic implementation
- Error model
- Base Component implementation
- Event Bus interface and implementation

## Phase 2: Service and Operation Implementation (In Progress)

Currently working on:

- Operation interface and base implementation
- Service interface and base implementation
- Plugin interface and basic structure

## Phase 3: Import Resolution and Integration (Next)

1. **Fix Package Organization**
   - We've reorganized packages to follow the existing pattern: `internal/domain/component`, etc.
   - All import paths need to be updated to use relative imports instead of absolute paths
   - Example: `import "github.com/fintechain/skeleton/skeleton/staging/internal/domain/component"` 
     should be `import "../component"` or similar during development

2. **Context Implementation**
   - Implement context wrappers to bridge between Go's context and our Context interface
   - Create utility functions for common context operations

3. **Adapter Layer**
   - Create adapters to convert between existing component types and new types
   - Develop compatibility layers for Registry, Factory, and other core interfaces

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Create comprehensive tests for all core interfaces
   - Test component lifecycle management
   - Test event system

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interaction between components
   - Validate operation execution
   - Test service lifecycle

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark component creation and management
   - Test event bus under load

## Phase 5: Migration

1. **Gradual Replacement Strategy**
   - Identify dependent components in the existing system
   - Create migration plan for each component
   - Prioritize based on dependencies and complexity

2. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect new design
   - Create migration guides for teams

3. **Integration**
   - Move from staging area to main codebase
   - Replace components one by one

## Phase 6: Extension and Optimization

1. **Plugin System Implementation**
   - Complete plugin loading/unloading
   - Implement plugin isolation
   - Add plugin versioning support

2. **Advanced Component Features**
   - Implement dependency resolution
   - Add support for conditional component initialization
   - Create component health monitoring

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize component lookup
   - Reduce memory overhead
   - Improve event bus throughput

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Completed
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4: 2 weeks
- Phase 5: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 6: Ongoing

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Risk: Breaking existing functionality
   - Mitigation: Robust adapter layer and comprehensive testing

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Risk: New design might introduce overhead
   - Mitigation: Performance testing and optimization in phase 4 and 6

3. **Migration Complexity**
   - Risk: Complex dependencies make migration difficult
   - Mitigation: Gradual, well-planned migration with validation at each step
