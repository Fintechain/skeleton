# Mock Implementation and Testing Request

## Task Overview
Following the dependency injection refactoring of the Go package at `[PACKAGE_PATH]`, we now need comprehensive unit tests using mock implementations. This second phase focuses on creating appropriate mocks and unit tests to achieve 90% test coverage.

## Mocking and Testing Patterns

### 1. Mock Implementation Pattern
- Create mocks only for external dependencies, following Go standards
- Place mock files in a `[PACKAGE_PATH]/mocks` under the package/directory as the tests that use them
- Use consistent naming: `*_mock.go` (e.g., `storage_mock.go`)
- Each mock should implement the corresponding dependency interface fully
- Do not create mocks for code in the package only create mocks for external dependencies for other packages

Example:
```go
// storage_mock.go - in the same package as your tests
package mypackage

type MockStorage struct {
    // Fields needed for test control
    GetFunc func(key []byte) ([]byte, error)
    SetFunc func(key, value []byte) error
    // Track method calls for verification
    GetCalls [][]byte
}

// Implement all interface methods
func (m *MockStorage) Get(key []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    if m.GetFunc != nil {
        m.GetCalls = append(m.GetCalls, key)
        return m.GetFunc(key)
    }
    return nil, errors.New("mock not implemented")
}

func (m *MockStorage) Set(key, value []byte) error {
    // Implementation
}
```

### 2. Test Implementation Pattern
- **CRITICAL**: Every file with code logic must have a corresponding test file
- Focus exclusively on unit tests (not integration tests)
- Tests should inject mock dependencies to test business logic in isolation
- Aim for 90% test coverage to ensure comprehensive validation

Example:
```go
// component_test.go
func TestComponent_ProcessData(t *testing.T) {
    // Setup
    mockStorage := &MockStorage{
        GetFunc: func(key []byte) ([]byte, error) {
            return []byte("test data"), nil
        },
    }
    
    component := NewComponent("test-id", mockStorage)
    
    // Execute
    result, err := component.ProcessData([]byte("test-key"))
    
    // Verify
    if err != nil {
        t.Errorf("Expected no error, got %v", err)
    }
    
    if !bytes.Equal(result, []byte("PROCESSED: test data")) {
        t.Errorf("Expected processed result, got %s", result)
    }
    
    // Verify mock was called with correct parameters
    if len(mockStorage.GetCalls) != 1 {
        t.Errorf("Expected 1 call to Get, got %d", len(mockStorage.GetCalls))
    }
}
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Review the refactored package to identify all dependencies that need mocking
2. Create mock implementations for each dependency interface
3. Ensure every file with logic has a corresponding test file
4. Write comprehensive unit tests using these mocks
5. Test normal operation paths, edge cases, and error handling
6. Verify you achieve 90% test coverage (using `go test -cover`)
7. Test should always be in the same package as the unit under tests.
8. Only create mocks for external dependencies (from external packages) and should the mocks should always be placed in the `[PACKAGE_PATH]/mocks` package
9. For interfaces within the same package, we should use test doubles or stubs as appropriate, but not create formal mock implementations in the mocks directory
10. When testing specific components, test implementations of local dependencies should be created within the test files themselves to isolate the unit under test

## Specific Requirements
1. **Unit Tests Only** - Focus on testing business logic in isolation
2. **90% Coverage Target** - This is a hard requirement
3. **Test File Organization** - Keep tests and mocks in the same directory as production code
4. **Test Readability** - Use clear test names and table-driven tests where appropriate

## Deliverables
1. Mock implementations for all external dependencies
2. Comprehensive unit tests for the entire package
3. Documentation explaining:
   - Test organization and approach
   - Any challenging areas and how you tested them
   - Coverage report showing 90%+ coverage

This testing implementation completes the refactoring process by ensuring the code is properly verified through automated tests.
