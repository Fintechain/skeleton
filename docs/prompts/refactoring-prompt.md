# Dependency Injection Refactoring Request

## Task Overview
Please analyze and refactor the Go package at `[PACKAGE_PATH]` to implement proper dependency injection patterns. This first phase focuses exclusively on restructuring the code to use interfaces and constructor injection, making it testable without changing its external behavior.

## Core Refactoring Patterns

### 1. Interface Substitution Pattern
- **IMPORTANT**: Utilize existing interfaces for external dependencies whenever possible
- Only define new interfaces when absolutely necessary (i.e., when the external dependency doesn't provide one, and then make sure the inteface is defined in the same package as the external dependecy.)
- Replace direct dependency usage with interface calls
- Keep implementation files unchanged externally

Example:
```go
// If the dependency already has an interface like this:
type ExternalStorageInterface interface {
    Get(key []byte) ([]byte, error)
    Set(key, value []byte) error
}

// Use it directly rather than creating a new one
```

### 2. Constructor Injection Pattern
- Modify constructors to accept dependency interfaces instead of creating them directly


Example:
```go
// New constructor with dependency injection
func NewComponent(id string, storage ExternalStorageInterface) *Component {
    return &Component{id: id, storage: storage}
}

```

## Implementation Steps
1. Identify all external dependencies in the package (databases, APIs, file systems, etc.)
2. Check if these dependencies already have interfaces defined - use them if available. You must check if the external dependencies already define the interfaces in their respective packages by review the package the dependencies is declared in.
3. Only define new interfaces for dependencies without existing interfaces
4. Refactor constructors to accept these interfaces
5. Update code to use the interfaces instead of concrete implementations

## Specific Requirements
1. **Do not change the external API behavior** - this refactoring should be invisible to consumers
2. **Minimize new interface definitions** - prefer existing interfaces when available
3. **Keep changes focused on enabling testability** through dependency injection

## Deliverables
1. Refactored code implementing dependency injection
2. Brief documentation explaining:
   - Which interfaces you used (existing vs. newly created)
   - How the constructors were modified
   - Any design decisions that required special consideration

This refactoring is the foundation for the next phase where we'll implement comprehensive testing using these interfaces.

Thank you!
