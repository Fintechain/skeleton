# Fintechain Skeleton Architecture Review Prompt

Use this prompt to conduct comprehensive reviews of the Fintechain skeleton architecture to ensure it maintains its quality, design principles, and provides a robust foundation for application development.

## Review Instructions

When reviewing the Fintechain skeleton, systematically evaluate each section below. For each area, provide:
- ‚úÖ **Strengths**: What is working well
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issues**: Problems or areas of concern  
- üîß **Recommendations**: Specific improvements needed
- üìä **Score**: Rate 1-5 (5 = excellent, 1 = needs major work)

## 1. Package Organization & Structure

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Package Independence**: Each package should be self-contained with minimal cross-dependencies
- **Focused Responsibility**: Each package should have a single, clear purpose
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Package structure should reflect architectural layers
- **No Monolithic Packages**: Avoid large packages that handle multiple concerns

### Review Questions:
1. Are packages organized by domain/function rather than technical layers?
2. Can each package be understood and modified independently?
3. Are there any circular dependencies between packages?
4. Do package names clearly indicate their purpose?
5. Is the separation between `pkg/` (public API) and `internal/` (implementation) maintained?

### Expected Structure:
```
pkg/                    # Public API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system/            # System lifecycle only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ component/         # Component management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service/           # Service lifecycle with factories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ operation/         # Operations with factories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin/            # Plugin system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/            # Configuration management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event/             # Event system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ storage/           # Storage abstractions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logging/           # Logging utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id/                # ID generation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ crypto/            # Cryptographic utilities

internal/              # Implementation details
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/            # Domain logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/    # Infrastructure implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ application/       # Application services
```

## 2. Factory Pattern Implementation

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Consistent Creation**: All major components use factory patterns
- **Configuration-Driven**: Factories accept configuration objects
- **Interface Compliance**: Factories implement standard interfaces
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling in factory methods

### Review Questions:
1. Do service and operation packages provide factory constructors?
2. Are factory interfaces consistent across packages?
3. Do factories support both configuration-based and convenience creation?
4. Are factory implementations properly integrated with component factories?
5. Do factories provide clear error messages with proper error codes?

### Required Factory Methods:
```go
// Service Package
func NewServiceFactory() ServiceFactory
func (f *ServiceFactory) CreateService(config ServiceConfig) (Service, error)
func NewService(name, type string) (Service, error)

// Operation Package  
func NewOperationFactory() OperationFactory
func (f *OperationFactory) CreateOperation(config OperationConfig) (Operation, error)
func NewOperation(name, type string) (Operation, error)
```

## 3. Interface Design & Consistency

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Interface-Driven**: Major functionality exposed through interfaces
- **Minimal Interfaces**: Interfaces should be focused and minimal
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar interfaces across packages
- **Proper Abstractions**: Interfaces hide implementation details

### Review Questions:
1. Are all major components defined as interfaces?
2. Do interfaces follow the "accept interfaces, return structs" principle?
3. Are interface methods focused and cohesive?
4. Do similar components have similar interface patterns?
5. Are there any leaky abstractions?

### Core Interface Patterns:
```go
// Component Pattern
type Component interface {
    ID() string
    Name() string
    Type() ComponentType
    Initialize(Context) error
    Dispose(Context) error
}

// Factory Pattern
type Factory interface {
    Create(ComponentConfig) (Component, error)
}

// Lifecycle Pattern (Services)
type Service interface {
    Component
    Start(Context) error
    Stop(Context) error
    Status() ServiceStatus
}
```

## 4. Error Handling & Type Safety

### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Structured Errors**: Domain-specific error types with codes
- **Error Chaining**: Support for wrapping underlying errors
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the system

1. Does each package define domain-specific error codes?
2. Are errors properly wrapped and chained?
3. Do packages provide error checking utilities?
4. Are error messages descriptive and actionable?
5. Is type safety maintained without excessive type assertions?

### Required Error Patterns:
```go
// Error Constants
const (
    ErrComponentNotFound = "component.not_found"
    ErrServiceStart     = "service.start_failed"
)

// Error Creation
func NewError(code, message string, cause error) *Error

// Error Checking
func IsComponentError(err error, code string) bool
```
